This branch consists the content for the wiki, which can be found under the Github-Pages

Using MDWIKI for documenting projects
--------------------------------------

Open the wiki locally:
Please open index.html with Firefox or look at http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!faq.md for more information about using other browsers.

You can also use a HTTP-Server, which will enable all features of MDWiki.

If you have Python installed on your computer (Windows) you can start a HTTP-Server with following command
`python -m http.server` or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from the directory, which contains the index.html. Then you can open the wiki
from any browser by using `http://localhost:8000`.

There are no restrictions, if you use a webserver, like Github pages,  to store the wiki.
